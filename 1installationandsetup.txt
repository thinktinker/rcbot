Set up and Installation Guide
-----------------------------
Follow the numbers in sequence within this repository to complete the software installation and set-up of the remote-controlled Arduino Robot. 

Item #1:
For those who have not installed Arduino, the codes available in this repo have been tested with version 1.6.5.
It can download it from:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous

Item #2:
The Arduino used for the source code listed here is based on an S4A EDU Controller Arduino Board:

Refer to the listed item '2 S4Ausbdriver.zip' for the driver and install the correct version for the system that you are using.

Alternatively, you can also refer to the website below to download the driver:
https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx

Item #3:
'3atcommands.zip' refers you to the Arduino code to set the AT Commands for the Arduino board.
In this example, we are using the HC-05 zs040 Bluetooth module. 

Be sure to refer to martyncurrey's tutorial (Method 1), to set up the AT Mode for your Arduino's Bluetooth (zs040) module.

Item #4:
'4softwareserial.zip' sets up the arduino to listen to serial data.
It is one of the commonly used methods to transmit commands / information from a mobile devlice to the Arduino.
Do refer to 'Item #3' where the martyncurrey explains how to set up the Arduino board for serial communication.

Also, suggested reading below:

Item #5:
'5PowerBot.zip' sets up the arduino to listen to / receive serial data, which is translated to commands to move the DC motors attached to the Arduino.
